# Open-Airfilter
Opensource airfiltering system for your home

Since i have problems with pollen in summer i wanted to buy an airfiltering system, but failed to find one that suits my needs.
Like being extremly silent or setting up schedules on when i want it to not run or that it should be even more silent when i want to go to sleep.

That is why i decided to just create my own and of course share my work.
